# Hero Section Brainstorming Summary

## Problem Statement

**User Feedback:** "I don't really like the main headline. We are agencies not trusted by any one. If trusted, it should be trusted by big branding media"

**Original Headline:** "Trusted by Agencies. Now Available to You."

**Issue:** Makes unverifiable claim about agency trust. GoAds is NOT trusted by big brand agencies — this headline is dishonest and could hurt credibility.

## Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Headline | Approach |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Uproas | "Unlock Limitless Advertising with Whitelisted Agency Ad Accounts" | Benefit-focused |
| EcomParkour | "Buy Facebook Ads Accounts And Business Managers" | Direct/simple |
| Proads | "Your #1 Agency for Advertising Profiles..." | Bold claim (#1) |
| Aurora | "Grow your business with the leading provider" | Generic premium |
| GCG Media | "AGENCY ACCOUNT PACKAGES" | Product-focused |

**Key Insight:** Most competitors make vague/unverifiable claims. Opportunity to differentiate with honesty.

## True Differentiators (From Discovery)

1. **Supplier to Agencies** - Uproas buys from GoAds at 30% off, resells at 2x
2. **Best Warranty** - 7-day 1:1 replacement, even for client mistakes
3. **Best Support** - Multiple testimonials cite "better than Proads"
4. **Vietnamese Sourcing** - Cheap, mass production, direct access
5. **2-Person Accountability** - Small team = real humans
