# Hero Section Brainstorming Summary

> **Date:** 2026-01-11
> **Status:** Approved
> **Section:** Hero Section

---

## Problem Statement

**User Feedback:** "I don't really like the main headline. We are agencies not trusted by any one. If trusted, it should be trusted by big branding media"

**Original Headline:** "Trusted by Agencies. Now Available to You."

**Issue:** Makes unverifiable claim about agency trust. GoAds is NOT trusted by big brand agencies — this headline is dishonest and could hurt credibility.

## Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Headline | Approach |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Uproas | "Unlock Limitless Advertising with Whitelisted Agency Ad Accounts" | Benefit-focused |
| EcomParkour | "Buy Facebook Ads Accounts And Business Managers" | Direct/simple |
| Proads | "Your #1 Agency for Advertising Profiles..." | Bold claim (#1) |
| Aurora | "Grow your business with the leading provider" | Generic premium |
| GCG Media | "AGENCY ACCOUNT PACKAGES" | Product-focused |

**Key Insight:** Most competitors make vague/unverifiable claims. Opportunity to differentiate with honesty.

---

## True Differentiators (From Discovery)

1. **Supplier to Agencies** - Uproas buys from GoAds at 30% off, resells at 2x
2. **Best Warranty** - 7-day 1:1 replacement, even for client mistakes
3. **Best Support** - Multiple testimonials cite "better than Proads"
4. **Vietnamese Sourcing** - Cheap, mass production, direct access
5. **2-Person Accountability** - Small team = real humans

### Visual ✅ APPROVED (2026-01-12) - REVISED

**Concept:** Product Cards Showcase (Option A)

**Reason for change:** Dashboard concept rejected - GoAds doesn't have a dashboard, ships through docs. Product cards show real products honestly.

**Style:** Dark & Premium (keeps Krea app chrome)

**Animation:** Keeps `animate-zoom-in` with 500ms delay after headline

**Background:** Black gradient fading to lighter gray at bottom

**Product Cards Elements:**

**Why Product Cards:**
- Honest (shows real products they sell)
- No fake features implied
- Clear value proposition
- E-commerce familiar pattern

**Competitor Visual Analysis:**
| Competitor | Visual | Why Not Copy |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Uproas | Cosmic globe + icons | Too abstract |
| Proads | 3D Facebook logo | Too playful |
| Aurora | Feature mockups | Would imply dashboard |
| GCG | Abstract spheres | Too vague |
| EcomParkour | Floating icons | Too simple |

---

## Why This Works

1. **Honest** - No false claims about agency trust
2. **Pain-Focused** - Addresses #1 fear (losing accounts)
3. **Benefit-Clear** - "Start Scaling" = desired outcome
4. **Verifiable** - 7-day warranty badge is true
5. **Memorable** - Problem-solution format sticks
