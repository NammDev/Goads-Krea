## What We DON'T Say

To protect Uproas relationship:
- ❌ "Cheaper than Uproas"
- ❌ "Why pay agency markup"
- ❌ Direct price comparison

Instead, we:
- ✅ Focus on our own value
- ✅ Let quality speak
- ✅ Position as complementary, not competitive

> "Reliable wholesale partner for your Meta asset needs"

### For E-commerce Brands

## Emotional Journey

```
BEFORE: Frustrated, uncertain, burned by vendors
   ↓
DISCOVERY: "Finally, someone professional"
   ↓
CONSIDERATION: "Warranty? Real support? Agencies use them?"
   ↓
PURCHASE: "Clear process, fast delivery"
   ↓
AFTER: "Stable. Reliable. I can focus on ads."
   ↓
LOYALTY: "Never going back to MMO vendors"
```

## Content Principles

1. **Show, don't tell** - Testimonials > Claims
2. **Specific > Vague** - "7-day warranty" not "great warranty"
3. **Professional but human** - Not corporate robot, not street slang
4. **Acknowledge reality** - Meta policy is unpredictable, we're honest
5. **Focus on peace of mind** - Emotional benefit over features
