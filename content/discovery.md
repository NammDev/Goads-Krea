1. Business Foundation

- Why did you start GoAds? What problem were you solving?
  Purpose: Deliver Meta asset–related products to advertisers.
  Market reality: Even large agencies consistently need Meta asset services.
  Core problem:
  Market is fragmented and unprofessional.
  Most suppliers operate in an MMO-style manner.
  Clients feel uncertain, unsafe, and lack trust.

Gap identified:
No agency-level provider offering a professional experience.
Lack of clear processes, accountability, and warranties.

Solution (GoAds):
Operate as a professional agency.
Provide structured processes and clear communication.
Offer reliable support and warranty-backed products.

Goal:
Create a safe, trustworthy, and professional experience for clients.
Elevate industry standards without changing market demand.

- How long have you been operating?
  Our first revenue is from 8/8. August $3k, September $10k, October $9k, November $12k, December $32k.
- What's your team size/structure?
  Just me and Justin. Only 2 people
- Where are you based? Who do you serve (regions)?
  Vietnam. We serve all around the world

2. Customer Understanding

- Who are your top 3 customer types? (e.g., "ecom brands spending $10k/mo", "affiliate marketers", "agencies")
  Uproas Agency: Which is our biggest client, they are new in this field, they mainly on renting Meta Agency ad account, when they know us they resell from us, event sell double as our price.
  Cody Cas: 1 solo advertisers, mainly do BH with his cloak. His setup is BM10 and page and 5 ad account which we can buy with very good revenue
  Bulletproof Scailing: 1 tele group from youtube kol which kind of famouse in this field. He said "Group Rules + Purpose \
  I created this group to connect all corners of the paid and performance marketing space (ecom, affiliate, lead gen, pay per call etc). I’ve spent a lot of years in both worlds and believe there’s so much value to share that isn’t communicated enough
  Group rules are simple
  don’t sell pitch/sell or I’ll boot you
  Add value, don’t just take
  Topics can be anything - media buying, conversion rate optimization, creatives, team building, investing, personal development and bio hacking - maybe even jiu Jitsu related 😂"
  He free for us to talk about our product. And its about new 5 - 10 customer permonth from this group. And They give us a lot of good feedback

- What's the #1 pain point they come to you with?
  They need stabled meta assets: profile, page, bm. Fast response, low price than others, better support, trusting issues

- Why do they choose GoAds over competitors?
  We have best wanrraty support and best customer support than Proads. We have better price than others. I don't know, maybe because the design and SEO

- Any real testimonials or customer stories you can share?
  "did you do the verified ones? non-verified bms seem to be shitty these days. we completely moved from proads to goads. better service"
  "I had very good experience with GoAds, haven’t used anyone else since trying them. Fast and reliable support."
  "I wouldn’t rely on one profile regardless - you can also do your own setup of profiles, BMs etc which is what the majority of us do whether you run on your own accounts or agency accounts
  @Justin_goads is a good source for buying profiles etc"
  "hit up @Justin_goads they sell bm's support is way better than proads lmao"

3. Product/Service Clarity

- Can you explain agency ad account rental in simple terms? (for someone who doesn't know)
  New ad accounts often have limits, restrictions, or bans.
  Agency accounts are usually pre-established, trusted, and more stable.
  The agency owns the ad account.
  The advertiser runs ads inside that account.
  The agency handles setup, compliance support, and account stability.

- What's the difference between your packs? Why would someone choose Elite vs Basic?
- the main point of user is they need ad account inside BM to run ads, they need pixel to tracking ads, they need page to upload content, they need profile to handle all of them, so the main different between pack is number of them.
- Another mainpoint is BM5 DSK $250 always more stable than BM1 because the BM5 is the one already running ads, which more trust than the BM1 which never run das before.

  - What happens after purchase? What's the customer experience?
    Almost very happy. Some said that using our setup is increasing ads fee (I think because the new setup). Some not satify becaue our product is not stable. But mostly because they don't understand this field enough. We can only offer what we have, best in the market, best we can do, but we cant control Meta policy. sometime they just randomly wipe a whole market

  - What guarantees/support do you provide?
    7 days warranty replacement 1 1 even becasue client make it die , except something from client which too much like running BH ads or spam

  4. Competitive Positioning

  - Why should someone choose GoAds over Uproas?
    We give Uproas product with better price. 30% off from our retail price. Then Uproas sell it to retail client. Of course they will choose us if they know about this. Otherwise they will choose Uproas because branding, SEO, blog, articles , etc

  - What's your honest weakness compared to competitors?
    I think SEO, Branding, Networking, lack of understanding in running ads. Biggest weakness of us is we have no idea about these field: running ads, dropship field, aff field.

  - What do you do better than anyone else?
    Oour product, we can source the Vietnamese market. Which very very cheap and in mass production in house

  5. Brand & Tone

  - If GoAds was a person, how would you describe them? (professional? friendly? aggressive? premium?)

“Guaranteed profit”

“No risk”

“Hack / trick / loophole”
