## 9. FAQ Section

### Q1: What is an agency ad account?

Agency accounts are pre-established advertising accounts with higher trust scores from the platform. They typically have fewer restrictions, faster approvals, and better stability than new personal accounts.

### Q2: What happens if my asset gets banned?

We offer 7-day warranty with 1:1 replacement. If something goes wrong within the warranty period (and it's not due to policy violation on your end), we replace it free.

### Q3: How is GoAds different from other providers?

We operate as a professional agency, not an MMO-style vendor. That means structured processes, clear communication, real support, and accountability. Agencies trust us as their supplier — that's our quality standard.

### Q4: What payment methods do you accept?

We accept Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer (Wise, IBAN), and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, USDT).

### Q5: How fast is delivery?

Most orders are delivered within 24 hours. Complex setups may take up to 48 hours.

### Q6: What support do you offer after purchase?

Fast response via Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord. We're a small team, so you get real humans who know your order — not ticket numbers.

### Q7: Why are BM5 accounts more expensive?

BM5 accounts have already run campaigns successfully, giving them higher trust with Meta. BM1 accounts are verified but haven't been 'proven' yet. More trust = more stability = higher price.
