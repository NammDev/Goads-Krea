## Section 7: FAQ Section

### Question Options

**Q1:** "What is an agency ad account?"
**A:** "Agency accounts are pre-established advertising accounts with higher trust scores from the platform. They typically have fewer restrictions, faster approvals, and better stability than new personal accounts."

**Q2:** "What happens if my asset gets banned?"
**A:** "We offer 7-day warranty with 1:1 replacement. If something goes wrong within the warranty period (and it's not due to policy violation on your end), we replace it free."

**Q3:** "How is GoAds different from other providers?"
**A:** "We operate as a professional agency, not an MMO-style vendor. That means structured processes, clear communication, real support, and accountability. Agencies trust us as their supplier — that's our quality standard."

**Q4:** "What payment methods do you accept?"
**A:** "We accept Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer (Wise, IBAN), and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, USDT)."

**Q5:** "How fast is delivery?"
**A:** "Most orders are delivered within 24 hours. Complex setups may take up to 48 hours."

**Q6:** "What support do you offer after purchase?"
**A:** "Fast response via Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord. We're a small team, so you get real humans who know your order — not ticket numbers."

**Q7:** "Why are BM5 accounts more expensive?"
**A:** "BM5 accounts have already run campaigns successfully, giving them higher trust with Meta. BM1 accounts are verified but haven't been 'proven' yet. More trust = more stability = higher price."
